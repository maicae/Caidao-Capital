		<h1>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h1>
</div>

<div class="c4">
	<div class="container">
			<p class="rst">CAIDAO 《財道》is an extract of a proverb meaning “The Road to Prosperity”.The proverb from which it originates captures the spirit of what we represent: Strategic, Financial, Wisdom. This philosophy begins within our team, is reflected in our products, and extends to our partners and investors.</p>

			<p class="nd">The Chinese proverb Sheng Cai You Dao “生財有道” emphasizes both physical and spiritual well-being at the highest ethical standards while on apath of fortune or wealth. Sheng Cai translates into “generating wealth in high spirits and bursting with life" and Dao simply means "road“. Dao is the same word as in Daoism (Taoism), which represents the balance of yin and yang, fortune and a life eternal. It is also translated as “The Way”.</p>
